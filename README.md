My first little project, my first steps to learning game development, simply using arrow keys or WASD, you can drive the car on the road and crash into the boxes, there is no main menu or pause menu, if you fall off the edge or want to quit the game, then you can close the game with ALT+F4 or hit Windows key and close the game via the taskbar.
